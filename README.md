# Roman Numerals Conversion

#### Webpage form to convert users input into Roman numerals 10 Aug 2018
#### By Krystal Foster

## Description

Experimenting with while and for loops, this website furthers my exploration into javascript by taking user integers and converting them into Roman numerals. Behavior-driven Development steps:

**Program Gathers User Input** | User input: "10" | Output: "10" |
| **Program assigns numerical values to Roman characters**| User Input: "1" | Output: "I" |
| **Program checks that no more than three characters are not repeated consecutively**| Input: "4" | Output: "IV" |
| **Program distinguishes betweens 1, 10's, 100's, and 1000's digit integers** | Input: "99" | Output: "XCIX" |
| **Program checks that input does not exceed 3999**| Input: "4000" | Output: alert("Cannot be converted!"); |
| **Program checks that input is an integer** | User Input: "Hey" | Output: alert("Not a number!") |
